# Understanding Java Collections, Collection and Collections Framework

![java collections](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2eb1c76-df97-4e8f-aa42-d74a20aab6c6)

Java provides a rich and powerful API for working with collections of objects. This is facilitated through the Collections Framework, which is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. In this blog, we will delve into the key components of the `Collection`, `Collections` & `Collections Framework` with the various interfaces and classes that implement these concepts.

Let's first understand the terms :
- Collection - It is a interface.
- Collections - It is a utility class which provides various methods.
- Collections framework - It is a topic/concept or a unified architecture.

## 1.Introduction to Collections Framework

The Collections framework is a part of the `java.util` package and provides a well-designed set of interfaces and classes that make it easy to work with groups of objects.

### Hierarchy of Java Collections Framework

- `Iterable`Interface.
- `Collection` Interface (root interface).    
- Major interfaces derived from Collection :
  - List 
  - Set
  - Queue
  - Map (though it doesnâ€™t extend Collection, it is a part of JCF).

### Benefits of Collections Framework
- **Reduces Programming Effort:** Provides useful data structures and algorithms out of the box.
- **Increases Performance:** High-performance implementations of data structures.
- **Promotes Software Reuse:** With well-defined interfaces, it is easy to reuse and extend.

## 2.Iterable Interface

It is designed to represent a collection of elements that can be iterated over. 

### Key Methods of Iterbale Interface 
- `iterator()` - method to travel element by element.
- `next()` - Checks if there are more elements to iterate over.
- `hasNext()` - Returns the next element in the iteration.

```java
Iterator it = obj.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
System.out.print(it.next() + ", ");
}
```

## 3.Collection Interface

The interface is extended by other interfaces like `Set`, `List`, and `Queue`.

### Key Methods of Collection Interface 
- `boolean add(ele)` -  Adds an element to the collection.
- `boolean remove(Object)` - Adds all elements from the specified collection to the collection.
- `boolean contains(ele)` - Checks if the collection contains the specified element.
- `int size()` -  Returns the number of elements in the collection.
- `void clear()` - Removes all elements from the collection.
- `boolean isEmpty()` - Checks if the collection is empty.

```java

// Create a collection (ArrayList)
        Collection<String> collection = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // add(element) - Adds an element to the collection.
        collection.add("Apple");
        collection.add("Banana");
        collection.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println("After adding elements: " + collection);
        // Output: After adding elements: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]

        // remove(Object) - Removes the specified element from the collection.
        collection.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + collection);
        // Output: After removing 'Banana': [Apple, Cherry]

        // contains(element) - Checks if the collection contains the specified element.
        boolean containsApple = collection.contains("Apple");
        System.out.println("Collection contains 'Apple': " + containsApple);
        // Output: Collection contains 'Apple': true

        // size() - Returns the number of elements in the collection.
        int size = collection.size();
        System.out.println("Size of collection: " + size);
        // Output: Size of collection: 2

        // clear() - Removes all elements from the collection.
        collection.clear();
        System.out.println("After clearing the collection: " + collection);
        // Output: After clearing the collection: []

        // isEmpty() - Checks if the collection is empty.
        boolean isEmpty = collection.isEmpty();
        System.out.println("Collection is empty: " + isEmpty);
        // Output: Collection is empty: true
```

## 4.Core Interfaces in the Collections Framework

### List
- An ordered collection (also known as a sequence).
- Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList.

### Set
- Does not allow duplicate elements.
- Examples: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

### Queue
- Designed for processing elements according to priority.
- Typically orders elements in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) manner.
- Examples: PriorityQueue, LinkedList.

### Map ( Does not extends Collection)
- An object that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed.
- Each key can map to at most one value.
- Examples: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap.

## 6.Key Classes in the Collections Framework

The classes which implements interfaces like `List`, `Queue` and `Set`.

### List Interface classes -

- ArrayList
  - Resizable array.
  - Preferred for searching.

- LinkedList
  - Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
  - Preferred for adding & deleting.

- Stack

  - `empty()` - Returns true if empty.
  - `push()` - Return ele in stack.
  - `pop()` - Return ele at top & then remove
  - `peek()` - Return ele at top
  - `search()` - Return index if ele is present, else return -1

### Queue Interface Classes

- PriorityQueue (Queue Interface)

  - `offer(ele)` - Inserts the specified element into the queue.
  - `poll()` - Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.
  - `remove()` - Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.
  - `peek()` - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.
  - `element()` - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue.

- ArrayDeque (Dequeue Interface)

  - `offerFirst(ele)`, `pollFirst()`, `peekFirst(ele)`
  - `offerLast(ele)`, `pollLast()`, `peekLats()`

- ArrayBlockingQueue (BlockingQueue Interface)

  - size is fixed
  - powered by array
  
- LinkedBlockingQueue (BlockingQueue Interface)

  - bounded if size is given else unbounded
  - powered by linkedlist

### Set Interface Classes 

- HashSet (Set Interface)

  - powered by hashtable
  - ordering of ele is not define
  
- LinkedHashSet (Set Interface)

  - powered with doubly linkedlist & hashset
  - maintains the order

- TreeSet (SortedSet)

  - powered by tree data structure (self-balanced BST)
  - maintains sorted order of ele
 
### Map Interface

- HashMap (Map Interface)
  
> - contains key : value pair
> - powered by hashtable
> - insertion order not fix
> - not contain duplicate keys but can contain duplicate value
> - null key allowed once but null value allowed multiple

   - `put(key, value)` - Associates the specified value with the specified key in the map. If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced.
   - `get(key)` - Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if the map contains no mapping for the key.
   - `remove()` - Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present.
   - `containsKey(key)` - Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.
   - `containsValue(value)` - Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value.
   - `isEmpty()` - Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.
   - `size()` - Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.
   - `clear()` - Removes all of the mappings from this map. The map will be empty after this call returns.
 
```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Apple", 10);
map.put("Banana", 20);
Integer value = map.get("Apple"); // Returns 10
map.remove("Banana"); // Removes the key "Banana" and its associated value
boolean hasApple = map.containsKey("Apple"); // Returns true
boolean hasValue10 = map.containsValue(10); // Returns true
boolean isEmpty = map.isEmpty(); // Returns false
int size = map.size(); // Returns 1
map.clear(); // Clears all mappings

   // Traversing using for-each loop (entrySet)
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue());
        }
        // Output:
        // Key: Apple, Value: 10
        // Key: Banana, Value: 20
        // Key: Cherry, Value: 30
```

- LinkedHashMap (Map Interface)
  - insertion order is maintain
 
- TreeMap (SortedMap)
  - insertion in specific order (ascending by default)

## 5.Collections Utility Class

The Collections class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.

### Commonly Used Methods
- `sort()`
- `reverse()`
- `binarySearch()`
- `max()`
- `min()`

```java
 List = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]
        Collections.sort(list);
        System.out.println("After sorting: " + list);
        // Output: After sorting: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]
        
        Collections.reverse(list);
        System.out.println("After reversing: " + list);
        // Output: After reversing: [9, 7, 5, 2, 1]

        Collections.sort(list); // List must be sorted before binary search
        int index = Collections.binarySearch(list, 5);
        System.out.println("Index of element '5' after binary search: " + index);
        // Output: Index of element '5' after binary search: 2
        
        int maxElement = Collections.max(list);
        System.out.println("Maximum element: " + maxElement);
        // Output: Maximum element: 9
        
        int minElement = Collections.min(list);
        System.out.println("Minimum element: " + minElement);
        // Output: Minimum element: 1
```
